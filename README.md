🚚 **DC Supply Chain Optimization & Profitability Analysis**


📌** Overview**

In this project, I analyzed supply chain data to understand where operational inefficiencies and profit leakages are occurring and how they impact delivery performance, margins, and overall business health.

The objective was to align logistics efficiency with profitability, identify risk areas such as delays and fraud, and support data-driven decisions across operations, finance, and supply chain management.

🎯 **Key Business Objectives**

1. Reduce late deliveries by identifying shipping and regional bottlenecks

2. Recover profit margins by analyzing discounts, categories, and markets

3. Mitigate risk by detecting suspected fraud and stockout patterns

4. Understand sales, profit trends, and seasonality over time

❓ Key Business Questions

1. Which cities, countries, and shipping modes have the highest delivery delays?

2. Are certain shipping modes consistently unreliable?

3. Which markets and categories are profitable, and which are loss-making?

4. Are high-sales categories actually generating profit?

5. Who are the highest-value customers contributing most to revenue?

6. Where is suspected fraud most concentrated geographically?

7. How are sales and profits trending month-over-month and year-over-year?

🔍 How the Analysis Was Done

1. Cleaned and standardized raw supply chain data using Python

2. Simplified and renamed columns for clarity and consistency

3. Removed unnecessary and sensitive fields to improve data quality and privacy

4. Created new metrics such as shipping delay variance to measure logistics efficiency

5. Loaded the cleaned data into a structured database for analysis

6. Used SQL to analyze logistics performance, profitability, customer value, and risk

7. Built Power BI dashboards to visualize KPIs, trends, and bottlenecks

8. Analyzed time-based patterns to uncover growth trends and seasonality

🛠️ Tools Used

🐍 Python – data cleaning and preparation

🗄️ SQL – structured business analysis

📊 Power BI – dashboards and data visualization

💡 Key Insights

1. Certain cities and shipping modes show highly unpredictable delivery delays

2. First Class shipping is the least reliable delivery mode

3. Some categories generate high sales but very low or negative profit margins

4. A small group of customers contributes a large share of total revenue

5. Specific regions show higher levels of suspected fraud

6. Strong seasonality exists, with sales peaking in specific months

7. Recent periods show a noticeable decline in sales and profit

✅ Outcome

This project delivers actionable insights to improve delivery reliability, recover margins, reduce operational risk, and prioritize high-value customers. It enables teams to move from reactive problem-solving to proactive supply chain optimization using data.
